## Pup-Inn

## Problem statement:
 We often see many animals (stray animals) are found injured and without shelter.
It is quite difficult for NGOs like "Love For Forgotten" to find and trace all such pitiful animals
and treat them. 
A common system for all volunteers, doctors and animal welfare workers to
easily track in a more efficient way for such animals and communication with each other
through technology is needed. An easy adopting system for stray dogs to have a better home
and tracking system to track stray dogs is needed 
## Solution:
Our approach has a multiway benefit for animals:
++ ** "Pup Home'' ** - is a small temporary sort of animal shelter that can be placed in places with no
shelter for stray animals. This uses installed minicameras/sensors to detect a pet seeking
shelter in bad weather conditions, etc and open the doors to a temporary home for them to stay.
++ Also during this period the sensors and cameras look for any signs of pain or illness in the
animals using the cameras (facial recognition) /temperature sensors and the system
automatically notifies the volunteers (or first responders) to help them.
++ The volunteers can then examine the extent of the issue and see if medical attention is
needed and get suggested first aid using the same portal. Also the system can show the
nearest vets available for treatment.
++ Pet-owners who have lost their pets can post the photo of their dogs along with the breed
name in the lost-found section of this system. The system also will be capable of identifying the
breed of the dogs and post the image of the dog in a lost-found portal along with location and
breed details notifying the users to check if it belongs to them.
++ All treated dogs will be attached with an unique ID for the dog and collar indicating that the
NGO has treated that and some cute image of that dog will be posted by that system publicly for
people to adopt it. The collar can have GPS tracking for regular vaccinating and also if anyone
comes up to adopt it. The collar will also have reflectors to prevent it from road accidents, etc.
 ## Technology Used:
+ ```OpenCV for image processing```
+ ```Python for computation and UI```
+ ```Discord server for easy communication```
+ Automated discord bot using ```(discord.py)``` for alerts and also an adoption system. Also for lost
and found systems.

+ ```Thermal sensors``` and ```chips``` for sensing temperature and creating unique ID for the ease of
trackin
